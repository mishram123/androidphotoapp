Android Photo Library Project group 04 Soban Chaudhry and Mannan Mishra

Hello this is our photo library app for android. When you implement this code in your own project please allow android studio to build a gradle
system for you so that this app can work on your laptop and your emulator.

In the home page, you can create, delete, and rename albums in your photo library. To delete or rename apps, please first click on the desired
album and press the corresponding button. To open an album, click the desired album from the list of albums and select the open album button.
Albums contain photos and photos contain tags about persons or locations

You can click search photos to take you to a new page that displays all the photos in the library, regardless of album, and u can search by
selecting the tag type and inputting your tag value to find it. If you find what you are looking for, you can click the open photo button to
dislay your search results

If you click open album, you will be taken to a page which displays thumbnail images of the photos in your album. You can delete images by
selecting the image you want to delete from the screen and pressing delete photo. You can add a photo to the album by clicking add photo.
This will direct you to your phones photo library. From there you can select the photo you want to add and it will come up in the display as a 
thumbnail image. If you are using an android emulator, you can add photos to your emulated device downloads folder by dragging images from your
computer file system to the emulator. The go back button takes you back to the home page.

If you click your desired photo and select Display photo, you are taken to a page with your photo displayed with a list of tags on the right hand
side of the photo. In this page, you can add a tag by pressing the add tag button. You can delete a tag by selecting the tag you want to delete
from the list and then clicking delete tag. This will remove the tag from the photo. There are two types of tags, person tags and location tags.
Select the tag type and enter the value of the tag. Later you can search for this photo using this tag type and value combo. The back button takes
you back to the previous screen. The next and previous buttons take you to the next and previous photos in the album.

If you select move photo, you are taken to another screen where you can move the photo in the previous screen to another album.
Select the album you want to move the image to that is not the album it was already in, otherwise you will get an alert. The image will be removed
from the original album and placed into the selected album. The home button takes you back to the startup page with your list of albums. 

We hope you enjoy exploring and going through our android app.
